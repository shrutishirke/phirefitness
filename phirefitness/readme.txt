== Description ==

Description of base theme: 
Hi. I'm a starter theme called phirefitness, or underscores, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.


Description of PhireFitness Theme: 
PhireFitness is a gym based in Mississauga,ON. The theme reflects the passion for a variety of fitness activities that the gym has.
The site contains a blog section that illustrates weekly workout activities such as Tuesday Training that a participant can take part in.

== Definitions ==

What is a Theme? 
A theme is defined as a set of files that create an aesthetically pleasing layout for a particular audience. A theme has
design components that modify the way in which the website looks in terms of colors, fonts and many other elements of design.

== Installation ==
The following steps should be followed to install the theme:
1. Have a stable internet connection prior to installation
2. In your WP admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button 
3. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
4. Click Activate under the themes tab in the WP dashboard to use your new theme right away.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Does this theme support any plugins? =

phirefitness includes support for Infinite Scroll in Jetpack.

2. How do I change the photos associated with the posts on the site? 
The custom-post type feature of the posts allow users to set any featured image within the WP Dashboard under 
Edit > Click on Featured Image > Change Featured Image > Upload and Image or Choose one from already existing images. You can
choose any image you like, and they will be sized exactly the same as each other from our automatically enabled CSS stylesheet.

3. Is there any Java Script used for the slider? 
No, there is no java script used to create the slider for this theme. Our team decided to use only HTML and CSS
code for the slider as we wanted the user to be able to style it in an easier manner if they want to in the future, since
Jquery is difficult to learn. Also, we ensured that the slider is HTML and CSS only so that it can run on sites that
do not have Java Script enabled. 

4. How do I change the photos associated with the slider on the site? 
The slider is a basic one. To change the images, in your server, name your images either of the following = (image1, image2, image3, image4, image5, image6, image7 or image8)
After this, you can upload the images in the images folder under the phirefitness file and they will automatically change
within the slider.
